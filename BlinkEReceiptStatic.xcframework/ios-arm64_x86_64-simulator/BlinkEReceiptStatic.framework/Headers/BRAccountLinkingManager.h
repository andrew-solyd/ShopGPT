/**
*  Use this interface to manage users' linked retailer accounts for parsing e-receipts. Here is the basic flow:
*
*  1. Implement UI to capture the user's credentials to one or more retailers from the supported list (see `BRAccountLinkingRetailer` enum)
*  2. Store these using `-[BRAccountLinkingManager linkAccountWithCredentials:]`
*  3. Call `-[BRAccountLinkingManager grabNewOrdersWithCompletion:]`
*  4. The callback to this method will return all order details available since the most recent successful invocation
